### notes on kombu vs shiitake

Kombu dashi contains glutamates (glutamic acid), and is the basis of umami, savoriness.
Dried shiitake dashi contains guanylate (guanylic acid), which supposedly enhances the umami receptor by [30x](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/10408398309527364). Although shiitake dashi it tasty, it's overpowering so you should use less if you want kombu flavor to come forward in a soup, and more for stew that will be flavored by soy sauce, sugar (mirin is sugar) etc anyway.
