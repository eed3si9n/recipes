### notes

This is a traditional cutting technique, but the credit for the steps goes to <https://cookpad.com/recipe/1531299>, originally written in Japanese.

The cultural significance of plum blossom is that it's often the first flower to bloom in the middle of winter. Thus in China it has symbolized the arrival of hope and spring. The tradition of admiring the blossom was ported to Japan, but cherry blossom became more popular later on.
